Welcome to Bash It, a fast paced game of reaction!
In menus, press the up and down arrow keys to move through the menu.
Press enter to select the currently focused item.
Press escape to return to the previous menu, or from the main menu, to exit the game.
To play, select play from the game menu, then choose a soundpack.
When you hear a sound in the left speaker, press the left arrow or the letter j.
When you hear a sound in the right speaker, press the right arrow or the letter l.
If you hear the sound equally in both speakers, press either the down or up arrow, or the letter k or the letter i.
soundpacks may optionally include a reward sound sequence for every 15 successful hits.
When the reward sequence happens, the background music will stop, and begin again after the sequence is finished.
To add a new soundpack, simply place the sound folder in the sounds directory. The game will pick it up automatically.
